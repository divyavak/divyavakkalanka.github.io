            <h2>Career</h2>
            <p>In 2014, Avantika won second place in Dance India Dance Lil Masters (North America Edition).[6]
                Vandanapu entered Telugu cinema in 2015 and was signed for two movies.
                She was selected to play the role of Chutki in 14 Reels Entertainment's Krishna Gaadi Veera Prema
                Gaadha, which was released in February 2016.
                However, due to the scheduling conflicts, she could not continue with the movie. Vandanapu officially
                debuted as a child artist in Brahmotsavam starring Mahesh Babu, Kajal Aggarwal, Samantha and Pranitha
                Subhash which started shooting on September 16, 2015. She then appeared in Chandra Shekhar Yeleti's film
                Manamantha.
                Later, she signed on for Premam starring Naga Chaitanya and Shruti Hassan, in which she portrays the
                younger version of Madonna Sebastian.[7] Vandanapu revealed that the key reason for her departure from
                Telugu cinema was the lack of variety in the roles she was offered which mainly consisted of playing the
                "heroine" or having a "small supporting role".[8]</p>
            <p>In 2021, Vandanapu played the lead role of Rhea Kumar in the Disney Channel Original Movie, Spin
                alongside Meera Syal, Abhay Deol and Aryan Simhadri.[9] The film received positive feedback from critics
                with Udita Jhunjhunwala of Firstpost commending her as a "delight'' further praising her "sparkling
                eyes, [as] she glides through the restaurant with as much ease as she finds her groove behind the mixing
                console".[10]</p>
            <p>In 2024, Vandanapu portrayed Karen Shetty in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical Mean Girls,
                based on the 2004 movie of the same name.[11] The movie received mixed reviews from critics, however,
                her performance was praised.[12] Writing for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw lauded Vandanapu as the
                highlight "among the mean girls," adding that "she gets the movie’s best song".[13] Speaking about the
                change in Karen's ethnicity from the original film, Vandapanu thought "playing that kind of character,
                especially as an Indian American woman is really, really crazy," adding that she was "excited to finally
                play a South Asian character that wasn’t reduced to being a stereotype".[14]</p>
            <p>Vandanapu will next be seen amongst an ensemble in the Anna Halberg and Spenser Cohen helmed Tarot[15]
                and is also set to headline the Disney+ original series based on the 1992 novel of the same name, A
                Crown of Wishes.[16] </p>
