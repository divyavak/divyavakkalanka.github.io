        <div class="container">
            <p>In the largest school system of Maryland, Montgomery County has worked to incorporate the student voice
                in
                the
                education system. The Montgomery County Public Schools Board of Education has one student member
                representing
                the 160 thousand students. The Student Member of the Board of Education (SMOB) is a full voting member
                on
                the
                board who is elected by all middle and high school students in the county.</p>
            <p>They can vote on budgets, school closing, boundaries and everything else except negative personnel
                actions
                according to the MCPS website. SMOB’s also receive a $25,000 scholarship for college, student service
                learning
                hours and one honors-level social studies credit according to the MCPS website. Voting for the 47th SMOB
                occurred on April 17, 2024 and the two finalists for the seat were Praneel Suvarna and Samantha Ross.
            </p>
            <p>Suvarna won the close election receiving 53% of the vote among the 58,000 students who cast a ballot in
                the
                election. He is a junior at Clarksburg High School and currently serves as the vice president to the
                county
                student government association and also as the junior class president at Clarksburg High. Suvarna’s term
                begins
                on July 1st, 2024 where he will replace Sami Saeed, a senior at Richard Montgomery High School.</p>

            <h3>The Special Elections Committee and New Changes</h3>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="container">
            <p>The Special Elections Committee (SEC) is the body that oversees the student led-student run election
                process.
                While any amount of students can file for candidacy, a nominating convention where student delegates
                from
                all
                middle and high schools cast their vote after hearing speeches to narrow the candidate pool down to two.
            </p>
            <p>Former SEC Administrator, Paris Ye, a student at Richard Montgomery High School ran the election for two
                years in
                2022 and 2023. Ye said that, “Voting elections is one of the major ways that students can make their
                voices
                hurt
                under 18. It's also an opportunity for students to practice the scale of voting, get in the habit of it,
                and
                realize their power to make changes in their community and their power to critically examine who they
                want
                to be
                leaving the community and what matters to them.”</p>

            <p>Over the past few years, the Special Elections Committee has been making efforts to make the campaign and
                election process more transparent and accessible. These efforts include conducting school visits with
                informational sessions, webinars with former SMOBs and finalists encouraging students to run and a more
                modern
                take on the “Meet the Candidates” video, where candidates share their platforms, and more. The video
                this
                year
                included questions from students from all over the county, instead of the SMOB asking the candidates
                questions
                like previous years.</p>
            <p>Voter turnout in this election has remained a huge concern, but has seen an upward trend in the past few
                years.
                In 2020, the pandemic forced the election to move completely online, unlike the previous years where
                voting
                would happen in middle and high schools in a designated polling location on computers. In 2021, the
                election
                took place over two days instead of the traditional one school day due to an abbreviated school day
                schedule
                that occurred while the school system mostly operated online.</p>
            <p>In 2022, the election remained completely online, while students returned to campuses due to convenience.
                Now,
                students are sent three emails over the course of a few weeks with a “Meet the Candidates” video,
                reminders
                and
                instructions on how to access the ballot. Since the change in 2022, the election has remained with this
                format
                where students are given time during their English or ESL classes to cast their online ballots.</p>

            <h3>Turnout</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Shella Cherry, the director of student leadership and extracurricular activities, who advises the SEC
                spoke
                to
                how the committee has been taking efforts to increase turnout. Their efforts have seen success with the
                jump
                in
                turnout going from 62.7% in 2023 to 67.01% in 2024.</p>
            <p>As the director of student leadership and extracurricular activities, she oversees the SGA advisors at
                every
                middle and high school who are in charge of disseminating election information at their schools. With
                schools
                that did not see a significant increase in voter turnout, Cherry said she will be meeting with school
                principals
                and SGA advisors to have a conversation as to why that may be and how they can better support the
                student
                body
                in aiming for a higher turnout in the coming years.</p>

            <p>Among the schools that had the highest percent increase in voter turnout were: Seneca Valley High
                School,
                Montgomery Blair High School, Montgomery Village Middle School, Winston Churchill High School, and
                Silver
                Spring
                International Middle School.</p>

            <p>Overall, the SMOB election has been an evolving process over the last few years, with major changes
                leading
                to an
                increase in turnout across the county. With a higher focus on accessibility and outreach, the SEC has
                been
                successful in educating more student voters in the 10th largest election in Maryland.</p>
